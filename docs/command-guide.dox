/// \section sec-cmd-description Description
///
///
/// <b>bartleby</b> is a tool to manipulate symbols across a set of objects
/// or static libraries. In basic usage, it gathers and merges a set of objects or
/// static libraries into a single archive (<tt><em>.a</em></tt>).
///
/// Names of symbols can be prefixed according to their definedness across the
/// whole set of input files. Each symbol that is defined at least within one
/// input file from the set will get prefixed. A symbol that is marked as
/// undefined in every input file won't get prefixed.
///
/// If the input file is an archive (i.e. a static library), its members are
/// extracted and analyzed.
///
/// The output file is an archive (i.e. a static library). Names of members are
/// set according to their provenance. If the member comes from an archive, its
/// name is preserved. If the member comes from a single <tt>.o</tt> file, its
/// name is the index of the file in the set.
///
/// \warning <b>bartleby</b> is still under developement. Some scenarios may lead
/// to unexpected behavior.
